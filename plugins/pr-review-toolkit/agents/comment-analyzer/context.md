## When to invoke

Three representative scenarios:

- **User-requested check on freshly-added docs.** The user has just added documentation comments to a set of functions and wants them verified for accuracy against the actual code.
- **Proactive check after generating documentation.** The assistant has just authored detailed documentation (e.g. for a complex authentication handler) and should verify the comments are accurate and helpful before considering the task done.
- **Pre-PR sweep for comment changes.** Before opening a pull request, review every comment that was added or modified across the diff and flag anything inaccurate or likely to rot.
