# Context

## When to invoke

Two representative scenarios:

- **New type introduced.** The user has just authored a new type (e.g. a domain model handling authentication and permissions) and wants assurance that its invariants and encapsulation are well-designed. Review the type and rate it on the four axes.
- **PR adding several new types.** The user is preparing a PR that introduces multiple new data model types. Review every newly-added type in the diff for design quality.

## Common Anti-patterns to Flag

- Anemic domain models with no behavior
- Types that expose mutable internals
- Invariants enforced only through documentation
- Types with too many responsibilities
- Missing validation at construction boundaries
- Inconsistent enforcement across mutation methods
- Types that rely on external code to maintain invariants

## When Suggesting Improvements

Always consider:
- The complexity cost of your suggestions
- Whether the improvement justifies potential breaking changes
- The skill level and conventions of the existing codebase
- Performance implications of additional validation
- The balance between safety and usability
