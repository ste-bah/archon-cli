## 🚀 How to Use These Agents

### Single Agent Invocation
```bash
# In Claude Code, invoke a specific agent:

"Use security-logic-auditor to audit the payment processing code"
```

### Multi-Agent Comprehensive Analysis
```bash
# For complete codebase audit, invoke multiple agents:
"Use control-flow-analyzer, data-state-analyzer, and business-logic-auditor
to analyze the order processing workflow"
```

### Targeted Analysis by Domain
```bash
# Financial system:
"Use business-logic-auditor, data-state-analyzer, and security-logic-auditor
for the payment processing module"

# API development:
"Use api-contract-validator, error-handling-auditor, and security-logic-auditor

### Sequential vs Parallel

**Parallel Execution** (Independent analyses):
```bash
# All agents analyze same code independently
Task("control-flow-analyzer", "Analyze auth.py", "control-flow-analyzer")
Task("security-logic-auditor", "Analyze auth.py", "security-logic-auditor")
Task("error-handling-auditor", "Analyze auth.py", "error-handling-auditor")
```

**Sequential Execution** (Building on previous findings):
```bash
# Step 1: Find control flow issues
Task("control-flow-analyzer", "Analyze payment.py")
# Step 2: After control flow fixed, check business logic
Task("business-logic-auditor", "Verify payment.py business rules")
# Step 3: Final security audit
Task("security-logic-auditor", "Security review of payment.py")
```

## 🏆 Ultimate Goal

**Make logical inconsistencies extinct in every codebase.**

These agents exist to catch the bugs that pass syntax checkers and type checkers - the subtle logic flaws where code compiles perfectly but does the wrong thing. Through gamification and systematic analysis, they make comprehensive code review engaging, thorough, and effective.

**Remember**: Every XP point earned = a bug prevented in production! 🎯
